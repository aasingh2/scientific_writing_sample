## Repository Contents

- **masters_thesis_1_Singh.pdf**: This file contains my first Master's thesis. The report is titled, "Estimating the micro-indel mutation rate in *Plasmodium falciparum*" where I used genomes from mutation accumulation experiments and developed a pipeline for variant discovery in non-3D7 strains of *Plasmodium falciparum* and then calculated the micro-indel mutation rate in 5 distinct strains of *Plasmodium falciparum* that have different geographical origins. This project was conducted at the University of Montpellier and supervised by Dr. Antoine Classens.

- **masters_thesis_2_Singh**: This file contains my second Master's thesis. The report is titled, "Balancing selection at the ’social supergene’ in the Alpine silver ants" where I analyze the 'supergene' to find signatures of balancing selection in *Formica selysi* by analyzing diversity, divergence, and deviation from neutral evolution in populations with different geographical origins. This project was conducted at the University of Lausanne and supervised by Dr. Michel Chapuisat and Dr. Helene Boulain.

- **Aakanksha_Singh_Eurobioc2023.pdf**: This file includes the presentation slides I used at the EuroBioc2023 conference, where I presented one of my current PhD projects titled, "Evaluating the efficacy of methodologies for Deconvolution of transcriptional profiles: A benchmarking study". The work is conducted at Goethe University Frankfurt and is supervised by Dr. Katharina Imkeller.
